## Minimal stub: only `walk_speed`, the one field `GroundMover.step()` reads
## for story 001 (AC-1a). ADR-0012 §9 defines the full `OverworldConfig`
## (every GDD Tuning Knob except `dt_max`, plus `waypoint_tol_m`, and
## `validate()` checking invariants I1-I18) -- widen this file in place as
## later stories add the fields each invariant needs, rather than
## duplicating it (same precedent as `src/presentation/presentation_config.gd`).

## The leader's full-tilt speed, in metres per second (GDD Tuning Knobs;
## safe range 3.0-4.0; default 3.5).
@export var walk_speed: float = 3.5

## Collision radius of the leader (and, later, of symbols), in metres (GDD
## Tuning Knobs; safe range 0.25-0.40; default 0.3; invariants I3, I7, I8, I9).
@export var body_radius: float = 0.3

## The largest corner overlap `GroundMover.step()`'s corner assist (ADR-0012
## §2.3) nudges the leader past instead of stopping it dead, in metres (GDD
## Tuning Knobs; safe range 0-0.4; default 0.25; invariant I9). 0 disables
## corner assist.
@export var corner_assist_m: float = 0.25

## Arc-length gap between neighbouring party members on the follower trail,
## in metres (GDD Formulas, `follower_trail`'s `follower_spacing_m`; GDD
## Tuning Knobs; safe range 0.7-1.1; default 0.9). `FollowerTrail.step()`
## places follower `i` at `(i + 1) * follower_spacing_m` behind the leader.
@export var follower_spacing_m: float = 0.9

## Distance between recorded follower-trail points, in metres (GDD
## Formulas, `follower_trail`'s `trail_sample_m`; GDD Tuning Knobs; safe
## range 0.05-0.25; default 0.15). Bounds how far a follower can cut a
## corner (`trail_sample_m / 2`) and how large the trail buffer grows
## (`FollowerTrail`'s `N_buf`).
@export var trail_sample_m: float = 0.15


## Invariants I1-I18 (GDD Formulas, "Load-time invariants"). Returns one
## message per failed invariant, naming its ID -- empty when every checked
## invariant holds. Every invariant that reads `walk_speed` also reads a
## field this stub does not declare yet (I11 needs `dt_max`, which is
## Presentation's; I3 needs `v_chase`; etc.), so this returns `[]` until a
## later story adds those fields and their checks.
